# REACTODE

So basically here will be creating a website using HTML , CSS(Tailwind) & Javascript

## Work Flow
You are not suppose to push anything to `main` branch. 
Will be creating a `Development` branch to first test your code and then later on merge to it to the main branch.
Create branch according to the issue number then a short description
Eg-  
```
Issue Number - 1 and its detail is  --> Added navar to all the webpages

Branch Naming will be ---> 1-navbar-all 
```
